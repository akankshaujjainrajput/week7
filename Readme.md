## ðŸ§  Models Used

Each model was tuned with GridSearchCV for optimal performance:

- Logistic Regression (`C=0.1`, `solver='liblinear'`)
- LDA (`solver='eigen'`)
- SVC (`C=0.1`, `kernel='rbf'`)
- KNN (`n_neighbors=15`)
- Random Forest (`n_estimators=50`, `max_depth=10`)
- Decision Tree (`max_depth=5`, `splitter='random'`, `criterion='entropy'`)

All models were trained using `scikit-learn 1.7.0`.
